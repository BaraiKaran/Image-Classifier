# Image-Classifier

The goal of this image classifier is to identify class to which an image belongs to. The way I am going to achieve it is by training 
an artificial neural network on few thousand images of cats and dogs and make the NN(Neural Network) learn to predict which class 
the image belongs to, next time it sees an image having a cat or dog in it.
